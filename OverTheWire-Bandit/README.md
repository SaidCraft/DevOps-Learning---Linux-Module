# 🔐 OverTheWire Bandit – My Linux Learning Walkthrough

This repository contains my personal solutions and notes from the **OverTheWire: Bandit** wargame. I'm using this challenge to build my confidence with Linux, sharpen command-line skills, and document what I’ve learned along the way. The walkthrough reflects my own thought process and growth as I work through each level.

## 🧠 What I Learned

As I worked through the levels, I got hands-on experience with:

- **Navigating the Linux file system** (`cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, `find`)
- **Viewing and reading file contents** (`cat`, `file`, `strings`, `base64`)
- **Searching inside files** (`grep`)
- **Using pipes and filters** (`|`, `sort`, `uniq`)
- **Working with edge cases** (filenames with spaces, symbols, or hidden attributes)
- **Decoding techniques** like ROT13 and Base64
- **Permission errors and redirection** (`2>/dev/null`)

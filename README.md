# ðŸ§ª DevOps Learning â€“ Linux Module

This repository documents my hands-on learning journey with Linux. It contains:
- âœ… [Linux Notes](./linux/linux-notes.md) â€“ Practical tips, command references, and troubleshooting guides from real experience.
- âœ… [OverTheWire Bandit](./bandit/writeup.md) â€“ A level-by-level Linux challenge focused on file navigation, decoding, and CLI tools.
- âœ… [SadServers Writeups](./sadservers/sadservers.md) â€“ Real-world Linux debugging problems solved through investigative CLI work.

Each section is a self-contained learning log designed to strengthen core Linux skills through active problem-solving.
